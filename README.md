# leonard
A collection of visualizations for UMass Professor Leonard for use in Circuits I/II

## Usage
The `index.html` file in the root of the repository serves as a table of contents, but each subfolder is its own visualization and can be used independently. Simply serving the whole directory on the web is sufficient for usage. A simple example would be running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the root.
